    RNA Alignment Assignment
    
    Implement each of the functions below using the algorithms covered in class.
    You can construct additional functions and data structures but you should not
    change the functions' APIs.

    You will be graded on the helper function implementations as well as the RNA alignment, although
    you do not have to use your helper function.
